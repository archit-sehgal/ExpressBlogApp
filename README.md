<h1>Express Blog App</h1>
 This code represents a basic blogging web application built using Node.js and the Express framework. It enables users to interact with the app by viewing existing posts, creating new posts, and accessing about and contact pages. The app uses EJS templates for rendering dynamic content, and it also employs the lodash library for text manipulation. The server runs on port 3000, allowing users to access the app through their web browsers.

This application serves as a foundation for creating a blog platform, where users can publish and read posts. It demonstrates how to handle routes, forms, and dynamic content rendering using Express and EJS. The code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it suitable for learning purposes or as a starting point for building more advanced features.
